# DevOps Bootcamp Task

This repository contains the code and configurations for the DevOps Bootcamp task, demonstrating various DevOps practices and tools.

## Steps

### Step 1: Version Control and Application Creation
- Initiated version control using Git to track changes in the codebase.
- Developed a simple web application using Node.js app.

### Step 2: Application Dockerization
- Containerized the application using Docker.
- Crafted a Dockerfile to define the runtime environment and dependencies.

### Step 3: Kubernetes Deployment
- Established a local Kubernetes cluster with Minikube.
- Prepared Kubernetes manifests (`deployment.yaml` and `service.yaml`) for deployment.

### Step 4: Setting Up Monitoring
- Integrated monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana into the Kubernetes cluster.
- Installed Prometheus using Helm and configured it to scrape metrics from application pods.

### Step 5: Visualization with Grafana
- Utilized Grafana to visualize metrics collected by Prometheus.
- Accessed Grafana's web interface and created custom dashboards.
